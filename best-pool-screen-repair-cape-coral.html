                    <h3>The Florida Weather Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cape Coral's subtropical climate presents unique challenges for pool screen enclosures. The combination of intense UV radiation, high humidity, salt air from nearby Gulf waters, and seasonal storms creates the perfect environment for screen deterioration. Professional repair services understand these local conditions and use materials and techniques specifically suited to Southwest Florida's demanding environment.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Protecting Your Investment</h3>
                    <p>
                        A pool screen enclosure represents a significant investment in your property, typically ranging from $8,000 to $15,000 for new installations. Regular maintenance and prompt professional repairs can extend the life of your enclosure by years, potentially saving you thousands of dollars in premature replacement costs. Moreover, a well-maintained pool enclosure enhances your property value and curb appeal.

                    <h2>Comprehensive Pool Screen Repair Services</h2>
                    <p>

                    <h3>1. Single Panel Screen Replacement</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most common type of repair involves replacing individual damaged screen panels. This is typically needed when screens develop tears, holes, or excessive sagging. Single panel replacement is cost-effective and can usually be completed within a few hours.
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box" style="background: #dbeafe; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Average Cost:</strong> $75-$150 per panel, depending on screen size and material type</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>2. Complete Rescreening</h3>
                    <p>
                        When multiple panels show signs of wear or your entire enclosure has aged screens, complete rescreening is the most economical option. This involves replacing all the screening material while keeping the existing frame structure intact. Rescreening typically costs 40-60% less than full enclosure replacement.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Pool Cage Frame Repair</h3>
                    <p>
                        Structural damage to the aluminum frame requires specialized expertise. Common frame repairs include:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="line-height: 1.8; color: #475569;">
                        <li>Bent or damaged frame members from storm damage or impacts</li>
                        <li>Corroded aluminum components from age and weather exposure</li>
                        <li>Loose or damaged attachment points to the house or deck</li>
                        <li>Sagging or warped frame sections affecting screen tension</li>
                        <li>Damaged door frames, hinges, or latches</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. Screen Door Repair and Replacement</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pool enclosure doors experience heavy use and are often the first components to require attention. Professional repair services can address spring replacement, hinge repair, latch installation, and complete door replacement when necessary.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Emergency Storm Damage Repair</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cape Coral's hurricane season demands quick response when storms damage pool enclosures. Emergency repair services address:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="line-height: 1.8; color: #475569;">
                        <li>Extensive screen tearing or complete panel loss</li>
                        <li>Structural frame damage from high winds or falling debris</li>
                        <li>Temporary enclosure securing to prevent further damage</li>
                        <li>Full assessment and repair planning for insurance claims</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>6. Spline Replacement</h3>
                    <p>
                        The spline is the rubber cord that holds screening material in the frame groove. Over time, Florida's UV exposure causes spline to become brittle and break down. Spline replacement restores proper screen tension and prevents screen separation from the frame.

                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #64748b;">When screening material pulls away from the frame, it creates gaps that allow pest entry.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #64748b;">Water collecting on the enclosure roof indicates structural sagging or improper pitch.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div style="background: white; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

                        Cape Coral's hurricane season requires proactive pool screen protection:

                                Single panel replacement typically takes 1-2 hours. Multiple panel repairs can be completed in 2-4 hours.

                            <h3 style="color: #2563eb; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">How long do pool screens last in Florida?</h3>
                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.8;">
                                In Florida's harsh climate, pool screens typically last 7-15 years depending on material quality, exposure to elements, and maintenance. Premium materials like Super Screen or pet-resistant screening can last toward the upper end of this range. Regular maintenance and prompt repairs extend screen life significantly.

                            <h3 style="color: #2563eb; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Can I repair pool screens myself?</h3>
                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.8;">
                                While DIY screen repair is possible for simple single panel replacement, professional repair is recommended for several reasons: proper screen tension, correct spline installation, frame assessment, warranty protection, and time efficiency. Professionals also identify underlying issues that untrained eyes might miss, preventing future problems.

                        <div style="background: white; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.75rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb;">
                            <h3 style="color: #2563eb; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Does homeowners insurance cover pool screen repair?</h3>
                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.8;">
                                Insurance coverage depends on the cause of damage. Most policies cover screen damage from named storms, falling trees, or other sudden covered events. Normal wear and tear, gradual deterioration, or lack of maintenance typically aren't covered. Always document damage with photos and get professional assessment for insurance claims.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div style="background: white; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.75rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb;">
                            <h3 style="color: #2563eb; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Should I repair or replace my pool screen enclosure?</h3>
                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.8;">
                                If your frame structure is sound, rescreening costs 40-60% less than complete replacement and can extend enclosure life by 10+ years. Consider replacement if the frame shows significant corrosion, structural damage, or doesn't meet current building codes. A professional assessment helps determine the most cost-effective option.

                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.8;">
                                For Cape Coral's climate, no-see-um mesh (20x20) provides excellent insect protection against tiny bugs common near water. Pet-resistant screen works well for homes with animals. Solar screening reduces heat and UV exposure for south and west-facing enclosures. All Screening of SWFL helps you choose the optimal material for your specific needs.

                            <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.8;">
                                Inspect screens monthly during routine cleaning, thoroughly after any severe weather, and schedule professional inspections every 2-3 years. Regular inspection catches small problems before they become expensive repairs. Look for tears, loose spline, frame damage, and signs of corrosion.
